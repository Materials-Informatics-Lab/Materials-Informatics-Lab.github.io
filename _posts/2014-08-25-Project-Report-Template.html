## Project Report

The project reports for this class will be prepared using [Github Gists](https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists).
I [personally](https://gist.github.com/tonyfast) use Gist to share codes, documents, thoughts, and notes.
Gists are great for short form discussions that are dependent on code or conveying an idea with minimal
need for style.

## Report Template

I have made a [Report Template](https://gist.github.com/tonyfast/0b33206724da2518ff44) that the class can use to get started.

### Making a Report Template

* __[Create a New Gist](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-gists)__

  _private_ gists can be shared via a link and _public_ gists can be perused on your [gist profile](https://gist.github.com/tonyfast).

* __Appending the Report Template__

  The [Report Template](https://gist.github.com/tonyfast/0b33206724da2518ff44) template is written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/); so is this [class post](https://github.com/Materials-Informatics-Lab/Materials-Informatics-Lab.github.io/tree/master/_posts/2014-08-25-Project-Report-Template.html).
  Markdown is minimal stylized plain text syntax that is easily converted to HTML.  I have provided links and documentation for
  [Markdown](#Markdown) below.

  Gists will be converted to Markdown when a Gist file ``*.md`` or ``*.markdown`` as an extension.

* __Iterate on the Document__

  Amongst your team, use the comment box at the bottom of the Gist to improve and iterate on the document.

  > **Example** - There is a comment from Dr. Kalidindi at the bottom of this [Gist](https://gist.github.com/tonyfast/0b33206724da2518ff44).

* __Submit the Document__

  Make your Gist public and share it with us.

##### **Pro Tip**: [Fork a Gist](https://help.github.com/articles/forking-and-cloning-gists) to edit the document contents yourself.


## __Markdown__

Markdown is plain text to HTML conversion tool.  Markdown uses minimal syntax to
 create both easy to read plan text and easy to format HTML.  Markdown looks nice in email and on the web.

### Advantages to Markdown

Easy to write.
Easy to read.
Easy to style... later.

### Syntax

* [Github Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
* [Daring Fireball](daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

### Interpretter

Try out Markdown with [Daring Fireball Dingus](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus).

### Extensions

[**Markdown Preview**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-preview/jmchmkecamhbiokiopfpnfgbidieafmd) for _Google Chrome_ accesses and inteprets local and remote Markdown files into formatted HTML.
