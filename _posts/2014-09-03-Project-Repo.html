## Project Repositories

Project repositories will manage your research

* **Posts** & **Data** using the Jekyll interpreter on the ``gh-pages`` branch
* **Codes** on other branches

  The ``master`` branch will be reserved for a special purpose.

* **Trajectories** with Github Issues

### 1. Initializing a Repository

Your project repository template will be initialized with a mini-research site.  You
will need to make slight modifications to the repository settings after you have forked the repository.
After a few easy steps, you will be ready to post your project content

#### 1. Fork ``research-pages``

When a users forks a repository they are provided with an exact replica of the repository that Github manages.

One member of the research team will moderate the mini research site.  The Other members of the
team will have their contributions tracked through Github and displayed on the mini-research site.

##### Forking the Page

Visit [``Materials-Informatics-Lab/research-pages``](https://github.com/Materials-Informatics-Lab/research-pages)
and click ``Fork`` in the type right of the page.

#### 2. Change the Repository Metadata

Let's get rid of the non-descript repository title and description.

> Often times there is information that can not be shared.  Describe what you can.

##### Change Title

Visit your new repository at ``http://github.com/username/research-pages`` then click the settings
button.

![Github Help](https://github-images.s3.amazonaws.com/help/repository/repo-actions-settings.png)

Then change the string in the ``Repository Name`` field.

##### Active Issues

Click Issues
GitHub Click the check box next to ``Issues`` under ``Features``.

##### Change Project Description

At the top of renamed repository, modify the description and URL to your mini-research site.

Your mini-research site will probably have the URL ``username.github.io/new-repo-name``.

###### Other metadata to change

Modify the ``README.md`` to describe your project.

#### 3. Configure Your Mini-Research Site

On the ``gh-pages`` branch, click on the file ``_config.yml`` and then edit the file by clicking on
the <span class="octicon octicon-pencil"></span> icon.

You will need to modify the following portions of ``_config.yml``.

{% highlight YAML %}
title: "My Blog" # Give you Mini-Research Site a title
email: you@somewhere.com # Contact info
description: |
  A short abstract about your research project.
baseurl: "/research-pages" # replace ``/research-pages`` with the name of the parent repository
url: "Materials-Informatics-Lab.github.io" # replate ``Materials-Informatics-Lab`` with your Github username
twitter_username: twitterhandle
github.user:  username
# Subscribe for a disqus username if you don't have one.
disqus: anotheruser
{% endhighlight %}


#### 4. Add collaborators to your project

Add your team members to the project and give them the appropriate permissions.

> Follow the [Github Help](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository) instructions.

#### 5. Share a Link to the Repo

Share a link to the repo in the comments here.

#### 6. Some First Tasks

* Make some posts with project discussions, documents, presentations, etc. relevent to the project.
