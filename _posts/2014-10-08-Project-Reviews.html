{% assign ref = page.references %}


## Descriptive Posts

These posts are good examples of organically growing reports on datasets that contain
minimal prior knowledge.  I both the posts we can track the history of knowledge growth
and similarly we can append variables in the front matter for later use.

{% for i in (6..7)%}
* [{{ref[i]}}]({{ref[i]}})
{% endfor %}

## Post Organization

The [Polymer Modeling]({{ref[12]}}) provides a great example for separating posts on different topics.

> What are good rules to separate posts?

## Data Pages

I made a post a while ago about [data files]({{ref[9]}}).  Data files can be accessed by
any post or page in a Jekyll site.  Currently, we have one [example]({{ref[8}}).  These files
should contain lightweight metadata for:

* Simple Analytics
* Pointers to Files
* Comments

## References

Lot's of y'all are managing your references really well!  Let's make it easier though.

References can be created using an array variable ``references`` in the front matter.
All the fields elements in ``references`` are appended to the end of a blog post
by the Jekyll template.

## Tagline

Add the field ``tagline`` in the front matter to create a short description of the post
on your blog index.

## Diagrams

Diagrams are absolutely critical to a data scientist
that needs to learn about our problem sets.  Most of this information can only be observed visually.

I love the diagrams belowbecause they are as descriptive as they can and do not
assume any expertise on the viewer:

{% for i in (10..11)%}
* [{{ref[i]}}]({{ref[i]}})
{% endfor %}

### Citing References

References are cited with the following syntax {% raw %}``{{page.references[i]}}``{% endraw %} where
``i`` is the index of the element in the arrage.  Appreviated references can be made
using the liquid statement [``assign``]({{ref[0]}}).  For example, in [another post]({{ref[1]}})
the variable ``ref`` is assigned [``{% raw %}{% assign ref=page.references %}{% endraw %}``]({{ref[1]}});
references are now access with ``{% raw %}{{ref[i]}}{% endraw %}``.

> Remember the zero-indexing.

## Disqus is Still Busted

On some projects, your Disqus comments are not working.  Ahmet posted [a solution]({{ref[2]}}) for this problem.

## Project Management

These projects have illustrated very descriptive uses of Github Issues and Milestones:

{% for i in (14..15)%}
* [{{ref[i]}}]({{ref[i]}})
{% endfor %}


## IPython

I hope some of y'all move towards IPython notebooks to conduct your research.  They are a useful
connection between the content and context of your research.

### Some Examples Class Notebooks

{% for i in (3..5)%}
* [{{ref[i]}}]({{ref[i]}})
{% endfor %}


## Reusable Front Matter for Blogging and Computing

> Q: What do I put in the Front Matter?

> A: Potentially resusable content.  (ie. links, statistics, commments)

In a recent [post]({{ref[9]}}), I show a IPython notebook that reuses the YAML front matter in the
python environment.  Post front matter can be expected to mature as a data file when the
as the veracity and value of the methods are assessed during the research process.  In an example [data file]({{ref[8]}}),
small statistics are included that can be used later.
