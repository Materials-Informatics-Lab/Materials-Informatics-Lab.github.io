## Object Storage

Dropbox, Google Drive, Amazon Web Services, yadda yadda are all object storage systems that allow access to data and metadata
anywhere on networks open or closed.  Commercial services are freemium, and consequently
a lot of features are exclusive and we have less choice on the fate of our information .

Yay Open Source!  [Openstack]({{ref[1]}}) is an open-source project building a free [cloud computing platform]({{ref[2]}}).
In class, we are going to use OpenStack's Object Storage Service [SwiftStack]({{ref[0]}}).  SwiftStack is an
[open source organization]({{ref[3]}}) with extensive contributions that extend it to
new interfaces, authorization services, modules for programming, scientific computing benchmarks...

## SwiftStack scales!

SwiftStack has an intuitive API with diverse applications in [scientific computing]({{ref[5]}}) or
[web application development]({{ref[4]}}).  You can do a lot of [cool things]({{ref[6]}}) with SwiftStack:

* Header calls can contain user-defined metadata
* Handles Small and Large Files
* Containers and blobs can be versioned
* Sharing files can exist from never to forever
* Automated back-up
* Federation
* Combination with other OpenStack features for Authenication and Computing

## SwiftStack on Storm

Georgia Tech College of Engineering hosts an instance of [SwiftStack]({{ref[7]}}) available to Georgia Tech
students and faculty via your Georgia Tech credentials.  The bare-bones
SwiftStack web console is not usable, don't try right now. _We'll use some third party clients to
interact more efficiently._

## Swift/Open Stack Clients

Below are two free clients to manage your SwiftStack accounts and objects.  Download _your_
respective client and input the required [credentials](#credentials) listed below.

### Mac Users :: [Cyberduck]({{ref[8]}})

* Create a new bookmark so you only have to do this once
* In the top drop down menu choose ``OpenStack Swift(SWauth)``

  You may need to install the [``OpenStack Swift(SWauth)``]({{ref[14]}}) profile for [HTTPS]({{ref[15]}}).
  After you download the profile you should have access to SWauth which authenticates SwiftStack independent of 
  OpenStack's Keystone Authentication service.
  
* Create an alias for this connection in ``Nickname``
* Fill in the rest of the [credentials](#credentials)
* You may be prompted for a password with is GATech password.

### Windows Users :: [CloudBerry]({{ref[9]}})

* Click ``file > OpenStack``
* Add a new account
* Set an alias in ``Display Name``
* Fill in the rest of the [credentials](#credentials)
* Make sure ``Authentication Service`` is unchecked.
* You may be prompted for a password with is GATech password.

## Credentials

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
{% for pairs in page.swift %}
<tr>
  <td>{{pairs.key}}</td>
  <td>{{pairs.value | markdownify }}</td>
</tr>
{% endfor %}
</table>

> GT folks do not use Keystone Authorization

### Other Services

* [ExpandDrive]({{ref[10]}}) - ExpandDrive will cost you money to save time and effort
in aggregating your cloud services.  It plugs into most cloud services effortlessly and
integrates them as drives on your local machine.  You won't even notice your data is floating in space.
* [**Python-SwiftClient**]({{ref[13]}}) - This is the API for Python.

  Please visit [this Notebook]({{page.pydemo.viewer}}) to see how both this Post and the Python-SwiftClient can be use
  to load information directly from your SwiftStack account.
